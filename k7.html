    The Dalai Lama himself has declared that his Gaden Phodrang Trust—not Beijing—will have sole authority to identify his reincarnation,<br>
    and he emphasized it should follow genuine Buddhist tradition.<br>
    Indian ministers like Kiren Rijiju have publicly affirmed that this is a spiritual matter, not political, and that “no one has the right to decide”<br>
    the reincarnation besides established Tibetan Buddhist tradition.<br>
    The Indian government’s Ministry of External Affairs has clarified that it does not officially intervene in religious affairs—<br>
    it supports freedom of religion without taking a position on reincarnation.<br>
    This clash over spiritual succession reflects deeper territorial and political tensions.<br>
    China views authorization of the next Dalai Lama, as a means to legitimize its control—especially<br>
    after installing its own Panchen Lama when the Dalai Lama’s choice was detained.<br>
